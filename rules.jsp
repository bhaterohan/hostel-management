        <p>The following rules shall apply to both MALE and FEMALE students residing in the hostels. Violation of any rule will make the inmate liable to disciplinary action including expulsion from the hostels and also from institution.<p><br><br>
        <p>1.Every student must remember that the hostel is the home of the student on the campus and therefore, he/she should behave himself/herself on the campus as well as outside in such a manner as to bring credit to him/her and to the institution.</p><br>
        <p>2.A student once admitted in the hostel will continue to be a hostel inmate throughout the year unless otherwise debarred from the hostel on disciplinary grounds. Unless they clear the dues, they shall not be allowed to take University examinations. Further, he/she may be expelled from the halls of residence and/or messes.</p><br>
        <p>3.Room furniture, electrical fittings, etc., are required to be maintained by the students in good condition. Students should vacate the hostel during summer vacation. If they have to leave any belongings in the hostel during this period, they should contact the hostel caretaker for the same but at their own risk.</p><br>
        <p>4.Residents shall occupy the rooms only after allotment is made by the hall warden concerned. Change of room may be permitted in exceptional cases, provided it is deemed necessary/justified by the Chief Warden. Unauthorized occupation of any room or exchange of rooms shall be treated as serious violation of disciplinary rules of the hostels. Residents found guilty of such violation of the hostel rules shall be expelled from the hostels without any further enquiry.</p><br>
        <p>5.No parent or guardian of a student is permitted to stay in the hostel. They must obtain prior permission from the Chief Warden to stay in the college Guest House only, (if such accommodation is available for a specific period on payment basis as per the Guest House accommodation rules).</p><br>
