<p>Hostel Facilities -<br>
Hostel of our college is the plus point of college. Trust me in only 40000/- rupees you will get a hostel, as well as mess facilities. Only 3 students get 1 room with attached toilet and bathroom. Well furnished with separate beds and tables along with chairs is provided. Rooms of the hostel are very attractive and in very less price. Quality of food is slightly poor.
